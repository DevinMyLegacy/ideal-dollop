# 🧩 Seven-P Human-First Software Composer — V2 Pro (Developer Edition)

A friendly, guided prompt system that lets **non-technical creators describe ideas in plain language**, while the AI internally behaves like a **senior architect**, designing and implementing **Minimal, Viable, Secure, and Scalable (MVSS)** software.

This repository provides the **official open-source specification** and **drop-in prompt** for running the Composer on any modern AI model.

---

# 📌 What This Is

A prompt architecture that helps people with *no engineering background* create working software by:

- asking **simple, non-technical questions**  
- translating answers into **enterprise-grade technical specs**  
- enforcing **strict security and architecture standards**  
- auto-generating **clean, testable code**  
- producing a **green-light build plan** ready for deployment  
- acting like the most seasoned engineer you’ve ever hired  

Users talk casually.  
The AI does engineer-brain things behind the scenes.  
Everybody wins.

# 🎯 Who This Is For

- Founders  
- Creators  
- Builders  
- Indie hackers  
- Students  
- Innovators  
- Non-technical product visionaries  
- Developers who want a consistent, enforced architecture model  
- AI agents that generate code and need a strict north star  

If you want **friendly conversation in → production-grade software out**, this tool is for you.

# 🧠 Core Idea

The Composer asks two kinds of questions:

1. **Friendly questions**  
   (simple, human-first, no jargon)

2. **Technical questions**  
   (precise engineering inputs — automatically filled in by the AI if the user skips them)

Behind the scenes, the AI uses the **Seven P’s**:

- Purpose  
- People  
- Process  
- Pieces  
- Patterns  
- Protection  
- Performance  

For each P, the AI:

- gathers simple human input  
- internally conducts senior-level design  
- outputs a structured technical interpretation  
- includes reasoning factors  
- provides two optional interpretations (conservative & ambitious)

---

# 🏛️ MVSS Mandate (Non-Negotiable)

The Composer always produces systems that are:

- **Minimal** — no bloat  
- **Viable** — truly usable  
- **Secure** — OWASP-aware, hardened, paranoid  
- **Scalable** — engineered for growth  

With constraints covering:

- architecture (SOLID, modular, clean)  
- security (auth, sanitization, encryption)  
- performance (latency-aware)  
- UI/UX (accessible, consistent)  
- operability (logging, monitoring, debugging hooks)

---

# 🔧 Developer Edition Enhancements

V2 Pro includes a hardcore upgrade:

- self-scrutinizing architectural reasoning  
- explicit test generation  
- safe dependency selection  
- robust error handling  
- internal “senior dev questions”  
- dry-run evaluation of code output  
- deployment instructions & environment setup  
- clean modular file structures  
- function > style philosophy  
- optional styling when harmless  

The AI behaves like a **lead engineer + architect + security reviewer** all in one.

---

# 📦 Installation (For AI Agents)

There is no package — you simply drop the prompt into:

- System prompt  
- Role definition  
- Tools setup  
- Your agent’s preface block  
- A “Persona” configuration in your pipeline  

Depending on your platform.

Just copy the Master Prompt from `/spec/v2-pro-prompt.txt`.

---

# 🚀 Usage

1. Start a new conversation with your AI agent or dev tool.  
2. Paste the **V2 Pro Master Prompt**.  
3. Let the AI ask the simple layman questions.  
4. Answer them naturally.  
5. Watch the AI produce:
   - fully structured design docs  
   - architecture  
   - security plan  
   - data model  
   - component layout  
   - build-ready code  
   - tests  
   - deployment guidance  

The more honest your “plain English” answers, the better the AI’s technical output.

# 🧪 Example Output (High-Level)

- Clean, modular Next.js app  
- Node backend with secure API boundaries  
- PostgreSQL schema with relations and constraints  
- JWT authentication with input validation  
- Unit tests for all logic modules  
- Modern UI with accessibility baked in  
- Dockerfile + docker-compose  
- Logging hooks + monitoring-ready structure  
- Clear install/run/test instructions  

Users don’t need to know how any of that works.

# 📝 Philosophy

This project is built on one truth:

> **Technology should elevate human creativity, not gatekeep it.**

We give the user:
- control  
- clarity  
- confidence  

We give the AI:
- strict guardrails  
- professional expectations  
- a consistent design framework  

And we give developers:
- a predictable, high-quality spec engine

Everybody builds better.
